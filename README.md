# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors Arena!** ðŸŽ‰

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The game allows you to play against the computer in a series of rounds until one of you wins two rounds to become the champion.

2. **Choices**: The player chooses between `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
3. **Result**: The game compares the player's choice with the computer's random choice and displays the result of each round.
4. **Scoring**: The first to win two rounds becomes the winner of the game.
5. **Replay**: After a game ends, the player is asked if they want to play again. The computer may or may not agree to a rematch.

## Rules

- **Scissors cut Paper**: Scissors win.
- **Paper wraps Rock**: Paper wins.
